# Key Observations Gathered from the Dashboard:

Top Countries for Shark Attacks: Between 1900 and 2017, the United States, Australia, and South Africa consistently recorded the highest number of shark attacks globally.

Peak Year for Shark Attacks: In 2015, shark attacks reached their peak, with a total of 140 incidents reportedâ€”the highest annual figure between 1900 and 2017.

Fatalities: The vast majority of shark attacks (77%) are non-fatal, indicating that most shark encounters do not result in fatalities.

Shark Attack Hotspots: New Smyrna Beach, Daytona Beach, and Melbourne Beach are the top three locations with the highest frequency of shark attacks.

Nature of Attacks: Most shark attacks are unprovoked, meaning the shark typically attacks without any prior interaction from humans, which may be the shark mistaking the person for prey or acting out of curiosity.

Month of Peak Activity: October experiences the highest number of shark attacks, accounting for 83.8% of incidents, with the second-highest month at 80.3%. This coincides with the peak of the hunting season for certain shark species, which move closer to shore in search of food. Additionally, October marks the end of the warmer months, when many people continue to surf, swim, and engage in water sports. This can be logically said that since there are more people in the water during the sharks' peak season, it will lead to more encounters with sharks.
