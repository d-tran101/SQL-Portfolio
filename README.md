# SQL-Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects where I utilized mySQL to clean, query, and analyze public datasets. Each project demonstrates my ability to write complex, practical SQL queries, extract insights from datasets, and perform data manipulation tasks using MySQL. Techniques employed are filtering, aggregating, joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, to effectively query and analyze data that aligns with practical business questions and goals.

The data sources utilized in these projects are:

1. HR Employee Dataset: Contains information about employees within an organization.

2. Restaurant Orders Database: Includes data related to customer orders, such as order details, menu items, and customer information.

3. Northwind Database: A sample database that simulates a trading company's operations, featuring diverse data related to sales, order details, suppliers, products, and customers.

4. Washington Survey Dataset: Captures responses from employees in Washington regarding their workplace experiences.

5. Reported Shark Attacks: contains information about reported shark attacks from 1900 to 2017.

6. Online Retail Sales: contains transactional sales data from December 2019 to December 2011 from a U.K based online retailer.
