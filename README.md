# SQL-Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects where I utilized mySQL to query and analyze public datasets. Each project demonstrates my ability to write complex, practical SQL queries, extract insights from datasets, and perform data manipulation tasks using MySQL.

The datasets utilized in these projects include: 

1. An HR employee dataset containing information about employees within an organization.

2. A restaurant orders database that includes data related to customer orders, such as order details, menu items, and customer information.

3. The Northwind database, a sample database that simulates a trading company's operations with diverse data related to sales, order details, suppliers, products, and customers.

4. A Washington survey database that captures responses from employees in Washington regarding their workplace experiences.
